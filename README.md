## 📌 Project Overview

This is a web-based financial information and sales forecasting system developed to support operational efficiency at Nasi Liwet Keprabon Bu Darmi Restaurant.  
The system manages financial transaction records, provides analytic dashboards, and predicts future sales using the Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) forecasting method based on historical sales data.

For secure communication between frontend and backend, the REST API uses HMAC-SHA256 request signing, ensuring integrity and authentication during data exchange.

This system was developed as part of a **Industrial Internship (KKP)** project.
